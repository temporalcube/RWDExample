            <h3>Who am I? Why did I build this page?</h3>
            <p>My name is Matt Henry, I am a web designer among other things.</p>
            <p>Of the many passions in my life, design is one of my major ones. I have been designing on and off the web since some time in the 90s, so it's been a while.</p>
            <p>In that time, many things have changed, and are still changing. Of those things, one major area ican be found in how websites are accessed. Previously most websites were reached through desktop and laptop computers, with screen sizes fairly predictable and large. Along with that, most connections to the web grew to be rather speedy. In recent times, however, things have changed, people access the web through a multitude of devices, from cell phones, to tablets, to computers and tvs. Connection speeds vary greatly, and screen sizes have become to numerous to keep track of.</p>
            <p>So, in an effort to adapt to the changing landscape of web devices, design and coding is changing too. Instead of creating sites for certain devices, it's time to create sites that can adapt to all devices. That's where this site comes in. It is here to provide a quick and dirty introduction to the concept of Responsive Web Design (RWD) through an operable web page. For now, the content in the site is just some basic resume-type material, but the core concepts of RWD are applicable to a wide variety of content categories.</p>

                <h2>How did I build this page?</h2>  
            </header>
<p>The first thing I did when I began building this site was to come up with the basic purpose and primary goals for the site. These goals boiled down to basically providing a brief overview of myself, and allowing for visitors to get a look into my process.
</p>
<p>Following that, I started organizing and creating a draft of the site’s content so that I would know how to organize and structure the page. This particular part of the process is key since good design inherently needs to be based upon the content, as good design is about communication, not just being pretty. 
</p>
<p>After creating the draft content, organizing it, and the site’s structure, I coded the basic HTML structure without any styling markup. I usually do this first as I want to ensure that even people using alternative browsers or older machines can access the content even if they don’t get all the fancy functionality. Also, to help provide a foundation to the site, I utilized a slightly customized version of the HTML5 Boilerplate.
</p>
<p>Diverting a bit from the procedure I'd undertake normally with a new design, I didn't step into Illustrator to build out the basic site look. Instead, I mainly just envsioned the site's look and structure in my head and went on building in the my text editor. The reason I was able to divert from my normal process in this instance was due to the overall simplicity of the site, and also since I had a rough breakdown of the structure from other site builds and my actual resume.
</p>
<p>After creating a mockup in Illustrator, I went back to the code and began styling the page using Sass. The initial styling was done to create a fluid base that would look acceptable, though not optimal on any size screen. Once I completed a basic page look, I added in some jQuery functionality to liven up the single page design a little. At the same time, I also added in some simple media queries to optimize the content for different screen resolutions. Note, with the media queries, I don’t base my design changes around device screen resolution as much as to resolution points where the content dictates a layout change. This approach helps keep the design from failing on devices with resolutions not yet known.
</p>
<p>Once the page construction was completed, I added in and refined the content further, changed the Sass configuration to output minified CSS, and then uploaded the site to a new url and hosting space.
</p>
<p>As I mentioned there are some points where I stepped out of my normal workflow to take advantage of the personal nature of this project. Also, if this were a non-personal project, there are some things I would do to further refine the design, content presentation, and the code, though hopefully, this overview gives a bit of insight into my process.
